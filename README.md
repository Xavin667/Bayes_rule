# Bayes_rule
Game that uses Bayes rule, to help user decide in which areas to search for a lost sailor.
Idea and base program from the book "Real world Python" by Lee Vaughan.

Further implementation of remembering searched coordinates in areas, finding the best strategy using Monte Carlo simulation and calculating probability of detection the sailor using each menu option written and implemented by me.
